# Customized script Rock and Roll

custom script for set time center and other display setup time
shadow text and re-organize day and time.
(im sure this isn't the best code)

### Customized

Hi! this is almost the same same as the original repo, just customize the "Rock" file, changing some stuff from the original like, setting up the text a little bit higher, center, and changing the format of time and some conditionals to make the day center

I'll use this repository to copy the same settings to my other pc, but if anyone need it, here it is. if you like it, add a star at original Repo please (read Authors)

##Appendix

I just want to share my version of this clock and set up an test image of how it looks
